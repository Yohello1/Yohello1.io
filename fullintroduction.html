        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><a href="index.html" style="color:#DDDDDD">Homepage</a><br> Everything in the box below would be my proper
            introduction.</p>
        <p style="border-style: double; border-width: 5px; border-color: white;"> I'm Yo Hello, I live in Canada, play
            video games, do vfx, and some coding. Right now I live in the mythical land of Canada, in the eastern time
            zone. I play a couple of video games mainly rotating through Minecraft, Civilzation 6, and Rocket League
            with friends. I play minecraft on a server with a few people, my base was hasily put together and wasn't
            really planned out. Civilization 6 I just disable Science victory so I can actually play the game. Rocket
            Leage is for when me and a few freiends just want to play a few games and have fun. Now for Vfx I just do
            stuff with blender, I've figured out most if not all of it, but I'm not to sure as of now. In terms of
            coding I've been coding since 2014, but in 2014 I was just trying it out and only learned the concepts.
            Later on in 2018 to now I've been learning a lot more such as a C, C++,C#, Python, and a few others I guess
            that is it?</p>
            <p>This isn't my resue for a job, just a introduction at some point I'll make resume and put them here</p>
