    <h3>Why didn't you see coding projects on the other page????</h3>
    <p>Long ago I started coding because, I wanted to be scecure. From what? My dad, he had a firewall that monitors
        network trafic in and out, because of this I decided to try and build a texting app with even better encryption
        so he couldn't spy on me. Now sure I could just copy paste code, and I knew that but I thought a bit further
        ahead. It dawned on me that I would have to maintain, and add features so I decided to watch a tutorial series
        (by giraffe) on html (gave up part way though) to learn css, js and others to make a app. Never made the app,
        moved onto trying making games in unity (by brakeys), learned the basics, then stopped. From here it was on off using scratch and python, then came Qaurintene where I tried out C and started programming again. Since then I've tried out unreal engine and Godot. I almost made a game in Godot only stopping because I couldn't get the art of anything from the person who was supposed to make it.

    <h4>Slope calculator in C, not my best nor my worst it's a bit old though <a

    <h4>There will be more later on though so, just wait</h4>
    <p>You'll see it soon enough</p>
