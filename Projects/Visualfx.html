    <p> Even thought I've been coding much longer than I've been doing cgi, and vfx I'm much more skilled at cgi and
        vfx. This probably happened because with coding I was all over the place, whilst on the other hand I did cgi and
        vfx quite a lot on a short period of time honning my skills and learning.</p>

    <p>Well, let' start with how I got into visual fx. It all started with my middle school IT teacher, Mr. Sakai he
        introduced me to 3D, and got me hooked to it. Sometime in January he told us to open up <i>Tinkercad</i> and
        watch a tutorial on how to use it. I didn't get hooked to it here. Later on he told us to constuct a model of
        something we were doing in Science. This is where I started to enjoy it, using booleans, making prinitives,
        generators, everything. Till now I had only used a paper and pencil to draw, and I wasn't very good at it yet I
        was able to make amazing things. I didn't even know this was possible, it opened my mind up to so much. For the
        next few years I played around in <i>Tinkercad</i> till oneday I wanted more power, thus I started looking into
        altrenitives like Blender, Fusion360, and the likes. In the end I chose Blender, because everything else needed
        lisences which were a pain to get. From there I just watched videos and leaned more towards doing simulations
        and VFX, I guess that is how I got here</p>
